# Theme Generator

Easily build a `base16` theme from the [terminal.sezy](https://terminal.sexy/) website

1. Find a theme you like on [terminal.sezy](https://terminal.sexy/)
2. Export it as `JSON Scheme` (copy the output)
3. Run `bin/build '...'` (pasting in the json that was exported)

The resulting theme is loaded in, and persisted to the `/dist` folder
